      <h2>What This Moment Is</h2>
      <p>
        The maintenance phase is the ongoing stretch of a course, after the beginning has passed but before the end. It’s where routines form, habits solidify, and learning deepens. This is not a passive period, but a powerful window for reinforcing a sense of belonging through daily interactions, instructor presence, and learner participation in community norms.

      <h2>Why It Matters for Belonging</h2>
      <p>
        In the research, designers noted that belonging is dynamic. The intentionality of the design from the preparation phase has now been nurtured and reaffirmed by faculty through commitments to language, connection, and routines. Some responsibilities for maintaining belonging are also taken up by students, who now play a role in co-sustaining belonging through their contributions to the community by adhering to the norms and rituals they ideally helped determine.

      <h2>Practice Strategies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Set up opportunities to model the behaviors learners can engage in to support belonging amongst each other, like providing example discussion response starters.</li>
        <li>Provide templates for faculty to give encouraging, growth-mindset focused feedback.</li>
        <li>Invite feedback from learners regularly via polls and surveys, and find small ways to incorporate it.</li>
      </ul>
