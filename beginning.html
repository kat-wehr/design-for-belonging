      <h2>What This Moment Is</h2>
      <p>
        The beginning of a learning experience is a pivotal time for establishing psychological safety, reducing ambiguity, and signaling to learners that they belong. In online courses especially, this moment can shape students’ perceptions of whether they’ll be supported, seen, and capable of succeeding. This moment includes early touchpoints like syllabi, welcome videos/modules, the first announcement or email, course rituals and norms for engaging.

      <h2>Why It Matters for Belonging</h2>
      <p>
        Instructional designers in the study agreed that at the beginning of a course, students are especially vulnerable to feeling "digital culture shock" and prone to feeling belonging uncertainty. The beginning of every new course is another opportunity to question their ability to succeed in this environment or if others like them have succeeded here. A couple of strategies that designers employed in this phase include using welcoming language that isn't overly formal, ensuring there are orientation opportunities built into the first week that explain the goals and reasoining behind the course activities, and providing opportunities to co-create course norms for engagement.

      <h2>Practice Strategies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Draft a welcome message that incorporates warm, friendly, accessible language.</li>
        <li>Consider including a "How to be Successful in this Course" document from a position of encouragment, NOT policing behavior.</li>
        <li>Use polls or surveys to invite students to participate in setting up the norms of engaging in the course.</li>
      </ul>
