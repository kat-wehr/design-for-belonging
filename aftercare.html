      <h2>What This Moment Is</h2>
      <p>
        A suprising outcome from this research was the importance of a strong ending. Similar to making a good first impression, belonging can also be supported through a lasting impression that not only acknowledges the conclusion of a formal experience, but also demonstrates support and encouragement for learners to continue the journey. Aftercare is an opportunity to engage in reflection, celebrate achievements, and reaffirm the commitment to learning as a lifelong endeavor that everyone is entitled to.

      <h2>Why It Matters for Belonging</h2>
      <p>
        Aftercare is frequently a missed opportunity amidst the chaos of final exams, grading, graduation or internships, and the typical resetting that occurs in the time between semesters. Students in online settings can be particularly prone to isolation and disconnect between semesters. Designers pointed out that this moment could be leveraged to sustain and extend belonging beyond the boundaries of the formal course calendar. By inviting continued connection and authentically celebrating learners' efforts, students' identities as people who belong not just in the course, but also in their discipline and the institution as a whole, are reaffirmed. A thoughtfully designed aftercare strategy can fortify that sense of belonging for online learners and may sustain them through future moments of belonging uncertainty, such as when they re-engage in a new course and experience that digital culture shock again.

      <h2>Practice Strategies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Make the experience feel less transactional by providing some sort of takeaway material, like an "executive summary" or one pager of what was learned.</li>
        <li>Invite learners to stay in touch via professional virtual spaces within your discipline, or through email or other platforms your insititution may offer.</li>
        <li>Provide some insight into how this experience supports learners in the next step of their journey.</li>
        <li>Consider creating space for learners to shout out one anothers' efforts or other forms of group gratitude.</li>
      </ul>
